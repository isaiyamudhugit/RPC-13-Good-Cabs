I worked on analyzing key performance metrics for Goodcabs, a fast-growing cab service focused on tier-2 cities in India. 🌟
Goodcabs stands out by supporting local drivers and creating sustainable livelihoods while providing exceptional service to passengers. With operations in 10 tier-2 cities, they’ve set ambitious targets for 2024, focusing on:

As part of this analysis, I evaluated their performance across these metrics, identifying trends, challenges, and growth opportunities. This data-driven approach aimed to help Goodcabs optimize their operations and enhance customer experience.
