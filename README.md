# RPC-13-Good-Cabs
I worked on analyzing key performance metrics for Goodcabs, a fast-growing cab service focused on tier-2 cities in India. 🌟
Goodcabs stands out by supporting local drivers and creating sustainable livelihoods while providing exceptional service to passengers. With operations in 10 tier-2 cities, they’ve set ambitious targets for 2024, focusing on:
 ✔️ Trip Volume
 ✔️ Passenger Satisfaction
 ✔️ Repeat Passenger Rate
 ✔️ Trip Distribution (New vs. Repeat Passengers)
As part of this analysis, I evaluated their performance across these metrics, identifying trends, challenges, and growth opportunities. This data-driven approach aimed to help Goodcabs optimize their operations and enhance customer experience.
Highlights of the Analysis:
📊 Repeat Passenger Insights: Identified cities with high and low repeat passenger rates and trip frequencies.
 🌍 Tourism vs. Business Impact: Analyzed how tourism seasons and business demand influence trip patterns.
 🎯 Target Achievement: Measured performance against monthly targets for trips, new passengers, and ratings.
 💡 Opportunities Identified: Suggested actionable strategies for enhancing passenger loyalty and operational efficiency.
